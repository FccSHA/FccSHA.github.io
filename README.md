## welcome to Shanghai(FCC)!

### About FCC Shanghai:

?	We are just a little piece of the [Free Code Camp Community](https://www.freecodecamp.cn) which located at Shanghai.

?	The reason that I came up with this whole **building-a-main-page** idea is that I think each individual community of this huge one should has their own independent website to post their informations. At this very moment, I am glad to tell everyone that the website is officially good to go.
